## Description

This event allows your app to subscribe to message events that directly mention your bot user in any channel or DM. This event contains the full text of the message in which your bot user was mentioned. You can both react to specific commands or respond with a general help message.

More information around `app_mention` can be found on our [API docs](https://api.slack.com/events/app_mention).

### Examples

## Implementation overview

### 1. Add a reaction to the user's message
