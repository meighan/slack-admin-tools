## Description

Your Slack app lives in a virtual place called an App Home. Users find it by locating or adding your app in their channel sidebar, under the Apps heading.

Your App Home is essentially a private, 1:1 conversation between a person and your bot user. It works just like a direct message between two users, using the same events and Web API methods.

By enabling the `app_home_opened` event you are able to greet users with interactive, educational experiences and unlock the full potential of your App Home.

More information around App Home can be found on our [API docs](https://api.slack.com/reference/app-home).

_Please note that this event only works in your app's DM._

#### Methods

* [`chat.postMessage`](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)

### 2. Show a help message when a user opens your App's DM

_Note: Only post a help message if there was some considerable time between the last interaction with the user and the last message wasn't a help message itself. Additionally give the user an option to opt-out of these messages by e.g. providing a "Don't show this again" button_
