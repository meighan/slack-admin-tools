###  Submitting a PR

Our open Web API specification is an artifact. It's the end result of an incredible machine (well, a Python script) compiling all the facts, fibs, schemas, and articulated examples across hundreds of individual files that describe our platform internally.

As such, we cannot accept pull requests on these spec files. Please file an Issue if you have questions, suggestions or feedback.
